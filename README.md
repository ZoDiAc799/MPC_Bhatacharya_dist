Most state of the art trajectory planning prediction and planning algorithms rely heavily on experimental
data or human behavior driven datasets. Hence, these models, theoretically, cannot handle
uncertain driver behavior, like bad driving, emergency vehicles and on-road adversaries. In this study,
we propose the use of an uncertainty aware probabilistic metric, called Bhattacharyya Distance(DB),
that can quantify safety of predicted trajectories. As proof of concept, we show that a DB based
penalty can drastically improve performance of an Model Predictive Control based adaptive cruise
control system in uncertain scenarios.
